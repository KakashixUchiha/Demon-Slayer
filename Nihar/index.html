<h1>HASHIRA</h1>
<p>
  The Hashira are some of the most interesting and mysterious characters in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Although all nine of the Demon Slayer Corps' most elite swordsmen have already been introduced, with seven of the Hashira debuting in one fell swoop, most of them have not reappeared since. As Season 2 continues, it's clear that only one Hashira will be in the spotlight this season, drawing the audience further away from the rest of the heroes who are so vital to the Demon Slayer Corps. Let's look back at each Hashira's introduction as a refresher on these ultra-powerful Demon Slayers.

<h1>UPPER DEMON MOONS</h1>
<P>The most powerful of these are handpicked by the demon kingpin Muzan Kibutsuji to gain even more strength by consuming more of his blood, and as many humans as they can get their hands on. They represent the 12 moons, 6 uppers, and 6 lowers, all of them immensely powerful.

Every Upper Moon had a chance to shine against powerful opponents, while most of the Lower Moons were either destroyed by Muzan. Only two true Lower Moons were able to demonstrate their abilities, along with another who was a former Lower Moon. The most powerful demons could only be felled by multiple demon slayers, as their unique Blood Art abilities gave them supernatural powers previously unknown to the demon slayers.
